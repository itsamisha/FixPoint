# Staff Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive staff dashboard with task management features. The dashboard allows staff members to view their assigned tasks, track progress, and manage task status through a workflow system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Task Management Workflow

- **Assigned Tasks**: View all tasks assigned to the staff member
- **Task Progression**: Move tasks through different stages:
  - Not Started → Assessment → Planning → In Progress → Quality Check → Completed
- **Progress Tracking**: Update progress percentage and add notes
- **Quick Actions**: One-click actions to start work, continue work, or mark complete

### 2. Dashboard Components

- **Statistics Cards**: Overview of total assigned, not started, in progress, completed, and overdue tasks
- **Task Cards**: Detailed view of each task with progress bars, priority badges, and action buttons
- **Progress Modal**: Detailed form to update task progress, work stage, and notes
- **Tab Navigation**: Separate views for overview, assigned tasks, in-progress tasks, and completed tasks

### 3. Visual Features

- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of task completion
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Priority Indicators**: Different colors for different priority levels
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Dummy Staff User for Testing

### Login Credentials

- **Username**: `dummy.staff`
- **Password**: `dummy123`
- **Email**: `dummy.staff@testcity.gov`
- **Organization**: Test City Government
- **Job Title**: Field Engineer
- **Department**: Infrastructure

### Assigned Tasks

The dummy staff user has been assigned 8 test tasks with different statuses:

1. **Pothole on Main Street** - HIGH Priority - Not Started
2. **Broken Street Light** - MEDIUM Priority - In Progress (45%)
3. **Garbage Collection Issue** - HIGH Priority - Quality Check (75%)
4. **Water Pipeline Leak** - URGENT Priority - Completed (100%)
5. **Traffic Signal Malfunction** - HIGH Priority - Not Started
6. **Stray Dog Issue** - MEDIUM Priority - Assessment (30%)
7. **Illegal Parking** - LOW Priority - Not Started
8. **Drainage Blockage** - HIGH Priority - Completed (100%)

## How to Test

### 1. Login as Staff

1. Navigate to the application
2. Click "Login"
3. Use the credentials above
4. You will be automatically redirected to the Staff Dashboard

### 2. Explore the Dashboard

1. **Overview Tab**: See statistics and recent tasks
2. **Assigned Tasks Tab**: View all assigned tasks
3. **In Progress Tab**: See tasks currently being worked on
4. **Completed Tab**: View finished tasks

### 3. Test Task Management

1. **Start a Task**: Click "Start Work" on a task with "Not Started" status
2. **Update Progress**: Click "Update Progress" to open the modal
3. **Quick Actions**: Use the action buttons to move tasks through stages
4. **Add Notes**: Add progress notes when updating tasks

### 4. Test Progress Updates

1. Click "Update Progress" on any task
2. Adjust the progress percentage using the slider
3. Select a work stage from the dropdown
4. Add progress notes
5. Click "Update Progress" to save

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

- **DataInitializer.java**: Added dummy staff user creation with assigned tasks
- **Report Entity**: Already had progress tracking fields (progressPercentage, progressNotes, workStage)
- **ReportService**: Added updateProgress method for task management
- **ReportController**: Added updateReportProgress endpoint

### Frontend Changes

- **StaffDashboard.js**: New component with comprehensive task management
- **StaffDashboard.css**: Styling for the dashboard
- **App.js**: Added route for staff dashboard
- **DashboardRouter.js**: Updated to redirect staff users to new dashboard
- **reportService.js**: Updated updateReportProgress method

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/reports/assigned` - Get assigned reports
- `PUT /api/reports/{id}/progress` - Update task progress
- `PUT /api/reports/{id}/status` - Update task status

## Task Workflow Stages

1. **NOT_STARTED**: Task assigned but not yet begun
2. **ASSESSMENT**: Evaluating the situation and planning approach
3. **PLANNING**: Creating detailed work plan
4. **IN_PROGRESS**: Actively working on the task
5. **QUALITY_CHECK**: Final verification and testing
6. **COMPLETED**: Task finished and approved
7. **ON_HOLD**: Task temporarily paused

## Status Auto-Update Logic

The system automatically updates task status based on work stage:

- Assessment/Planning → Status becomes "IN_PROGRESS"
- Completed → Status becomes "RESOLVED" and progress becomes 100%
- Other stages → Status remains "IN_PROGRESS"

## Future Enhancements

- Task filtering by priority, category, or date
- Bulk actions for multiple tasks
- Task templates for common issues
- Integration with calendar/scheduling
- Mobile app for field workers
- Photo uploads for progress documentation
- Time tracking for tasks
- Performance metrics and reports

## Troubleshooting

### If tasks don't appear:

1. Make sure you're logged in as the dummy staff user
2. Check that the backend server is running
3. Verify the database has been initialized with test data

### If progress updates fail:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend API is accessible
3. Ensure you have proper permissions

### If the dashboard doesn't load:

1. Check if the frontend is running on the correct port
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check for any build errors

## Notes

- The dummy staff user is created automatically when the application starts
- Test tasks are assigned with realistic data and different progress levels
- The system supports both individual progress updates and quick actions
- All changes are persisted to the database
- The UI is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
