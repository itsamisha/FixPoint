# Organization Dropdown Overlap Fix

## ðŸ”§ **Root Cause Analysis:**
The organization dropdown was being clipped and overlapped due to several CSS stacking context and overflow issues:

1. **Low z-index on container**: `.organization-selector` had z-index: 10
2. **Overflow clipping**: Multiple parent containers had `overflow: hidden`
3. **Stacking context isolation**: Form sections were creating isolated stacking contexts

## âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Increased Container Z-Index**
```css
.organization-selector {
  z-index: 100000; /* Was: 10 */
}
```

### 2. **Increased Dropdown Z-Index**
```css
.organization-dropdown {
  z-index: 100001; /* Was: 99999 */
}
```

### 3. **Fixed Overflow Clipping**
```css
/* Input wrapper */
.organization-input-wrapper {
  overflow: visible; /* Was: hidden */
}

/* Form sections */
.form-section {
  overflow: visible; /* Was: hidden */
}
```

### 4. **Special Form Section Rules**
```css
/* Ensure organization sections have proper overflow */
.form-section:has(.organization-selector),
.form-section.organization-section {
  overflow: visible !important;
  z-index: 100000;
}
```

### 5. **Added CSS Class to Form Section**
```javascript
// In ReportForm.js
<div className="form-section organization-section">
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Z-Index Hierarchy:**
- Modal overlays: `10000`
- Organization selector container: `100000`
- Organization dropdown: `100001` (highest)
- Other components: `< 10000`

## ðŸ§ª **Testing:**
1. Click on organization selector
2. Dropdown should appear above all other form elements
3. Should be scrollable and selectable
4. Should not be clipped by parent containers
5. Should close when clicking outside

## ðŸ“‹ **What This Fixes:**
- âœ… Dropdown appears above CategorySelector
- âœ… Dropdown appears above all form sections
- âœ… Dropdown is not clipped by parent containers
- âœ… Dropdown maintains proper positioning
- âœ… Dropdown scrolling works correctly

The organization dropdown should now appear on top of all other components without any overlap issues!
