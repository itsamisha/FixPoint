# ReportForm Issues Fixed

## ‚úÖ Issues Addressed:

### 1. **AI Description Generator Button Not Working**
**Problem:** Button click wasn't working due to prop mismatch
**Solution:** 
- Fixed prop name from `analyzeImageWithAI` to `onAnalyze` in AIDescriptionGenerator component
- Added missing props: `aiGeneratedDescription`, `showAiDescription`, `useAIDescription`, `editAIDescription`
- Updated the analyze function to show preview instead of applying directly

### 2. **Organization Dropdown Hidden Below Other Components**
**Problem:** Z-index was too low (9999)
**Solution:** 
- Increased organization dropdown z-index from 9999 to 99999
- This ensures it appears above CategorySelector (z-index: 2) and other components

### 3. **Translate Back to English Not Available**
**Problem:** Only Bangla translation was available
**Solution:** 
- Added `translateDescriptionToEnglish()` function
- Added `restoreOriginalDescription()` function
- Switched to `EnhancedAIDescriptionGenerator` component
- Added translation UI with both Bangla and English options
- Added restore original functionality
- Added proper CSS styling for translation buttons
