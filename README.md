> **FixPoint** is a comprehensive web application that connects citizens with local authorities to report and resolve civic issues in their communities. Built with Spring Boot backend and React frontend, it promotes civic engagement, transparency, and collaborative problem-solving through AI-powered features and real-time communication.

## The Problem

In many urban and semi-urban neighborhoods, small civic problems such as broken streetlights, potholes, garbage overflow, and stray animals often go unreported and unattended. Citizens are frequently unsure of where to report such problems, or they feel disheartened by the lack of visible response.

## Our Solution

**FixPoint addresses this challenge by providing a user-friendly web application that enables residents to report local issues quickly and easily.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd FixPoint
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

**Access the application:**
